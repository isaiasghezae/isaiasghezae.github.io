I'm a Research Coordinator at the [Polarization and Social Change Lab](https://www.pascl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and a Research Affiliate at the [Center for the Science of Moral Understanding](https://www.moralunderstanding.com/).

In June 2022, I earned a B.S. in Psychological & Brain Sciences from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I was a [Barry Goldwater Scholar](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and a [McNair Scholar](https://mcnairscholars.com/about/).

While at UC Santa Barbara I mainly worked with Dr. Daniel Conroy-Beam and Dr. Hongbo Yu. I spent a summer as a BrainWAVE Fellow at Caltech's [Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/), working with Dr. Colin Camerer and his Behavioral and Neuroeconomics Group. I am also a previous participant of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology's [SPUR](https://spsp.org/professional-development/training-programs/social-personality-undergraduate-research-spur-program) program.
