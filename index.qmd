::: {.a style="text-align: left"}
I'm a Research Coordinator at the [Polarization and Social Change Lab](https://www.pascl.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and a Research Affiliate at the [Center for the Science of Moral Understanding](https://www.moralunderstanding.com/). I graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in June 2022 with a B.S. in Psychological & Brain Sciences.

While at UC Santa Barbara I mainly worked with [Dr. Daniel Conroy-Beam](https://psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/daniel-conroy-beam) and [Dr. Hongbo Yu](https://psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/hongbo-yu). I spent a summer as a BrainWAVE Fellow at Caltech's Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience, where I worked full-time with [Dr. Colin Camerer](https://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/colin-f-camerer) and his Behavioral and Neuroeconomics Group. I am also a previous participant of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology's [SPUR](https://spsp.org/professional-development/training-programs/social-personality-undergraduate-research-spur-program) program.
