    "text": "My research interests lie at the intersection of intergroup cognition, moral psychology, and political psychology. I am particularly focused on the formation of moral and political beliefs and behavior, with an emphasis on how group motivations may influence these processes. To investigate these topics, I use methods from experimental social psychology, cognitive science, and computational social science.\n\nPreprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhezae, I., & Yu, H.
